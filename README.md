# Nifty-50-Price-Prediction-using-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Predict stock prices using machine learning with sentiment analysis of financial news. This project combines historical stock data with sentiment scores to capture the influence of market sentiment on price movements.
This project leverages a pre-existing dataset of Nifty-50 financial news (January 2017 to April 2021) and corresponding Nifty-50 stock data for the same period. The primary objective was to analyze the influence of financial news sentiment on overall market price movements.Conclusion
# Conclusion
Based on the analysis of this financial news dataset, the findings suggest that the sentiment extracted from financial news has a very weak correlation with stock price movements in the overall market.
# Future Work
Alternative Market Index: Future research can explore using Sensex as the market index to analyze the influence of financial news sentiment. This may provide a broader or different perspective compared to Nifty-50.
